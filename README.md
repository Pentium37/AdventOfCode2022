# AdventOfCode2022
Here are my solutions to this years Advent of Code.

NOTE: This code is absolute whack and I would never write solutions so weird and unique if it were to be maintained. So don't be judgemental and read my code at your own risk!

Solutions are contained within the src alongside the util which contains blocks of code frequently used by many different problems. My test data is contained within its own directory and if you would like to test different data, just replace the existing ones in the txt files.
